## Problem

The stps-extension codebase needs a comprehensive review to ensure all functions follow best practices. This includes checking for:
- Code quality and consistency
- Error handling patterns
- Memory management
- Security considerations
- API design conventions
- Documentation completeness
- Performance optimizations

## Solution

TBD - Conduct a systematic audit of the extension's functions, documenting findings and creating actionable improvements.
